# BioChain: Securing Genomic Data with Web3

## Hackathon Project

Built for the Bioinformatics × Blockchain Hackathon 2026.

BioChain is a Web3-based platform for secure storage, verification, and traceability of genomic datasets using blockchain and decentralized storage.

## Problem

Genomic data is sensitive, can be altered, and is difficult to verify for authenticity and origin. There is no reliable decentralized system to ensure integrity and traceability of biological datasets.

## Solution

This project provides a system that:

* Stores genomic dataset hashes on blockchain
* Uses IPFS for decentralized file storage
* Enables tamper-proof verification
* Maintains traceability of genome records

## Workflow

1. Upload genome dataset (FASTA or sequence file)
2. Store file on IPFS
3. Generate cryptographic hash
4. Record hash on blockchain using a smart contract
5. Verify dataset integrity using stored hash

## Tech Stack

* Blockchain: Ethereum / Polygon
* Smart Contracts: Hardhat
* Storage: IPFS
* Backend: Node.js
* Bioinformatics: Python, Biopython

## Features

* Immutable record of genomic data
* Decentralized storage
* Data authenticity verification
* Transparent tracking of dataset origin

## Use Cases

* Research data validation
* Secure sharing of genomic datasets
* Traceability in bioinformatics workflows
* Phage therapy and genetic research data management

## Setup

1. Install Node.js
2. Install Hardhat
3. Install MetaMask
4. Install Python and Biopython
5. Install IPFS Desktop

## Future Work

* User interface for dataset upload and verification
* Integration with public genomic databases
* Role-based access using smart contracts
* Automated data validation pipeline
